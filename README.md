## 📑 Course Description  

The course introduces students to **data-driven approaches in systems engineering**, providing both theoretical foundations and practical implementations in Python. The content is divided into three main sections:  

### 1. Data Analysis using Python  
- **1.1 Introduction to Python** and its applications in data analysis  
- **1.2 Data cleaning and preprocessing techniques**  
- **1.3 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Visualization**  
- **1.4 Machine Learning for Data Analysis**  

### 2. Software Engineering  
- **2.1 Software Evolution**: software lifecycle, costs, maintenance, logical design, and real-world models  
- **2.2 Methodologies**: software development models (Waterfall, Prototyping Cycle, Agile), Agile vs. Traditional approaches, Extreme Programming Guidelines  
- **2.3 Unified Modeling Language (UML)**: visual design approaches, advantages of diagrams, types of UML diagrams  

### 3. Model Learning Operations (MLOps)  
- **3.1 MLOps - What and Why**: significance and purpose in ML workflows  
- **3.2 People in MLOps**: roles of data scientists, engineers, and DevOps professionals  
- **3.3 MLOps - Features**: automation, monitoring, collaboration tools  
- **3.4 MLOps - Practice**: deployment, version control, CI/CD pipelines  
- **3.5 Data Representation, Data Science, and Data Engineering**: representation techniques, principles, and fundamentals
